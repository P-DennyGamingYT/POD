# P-Denny Obfuscation Delivery
P-Denny Obfuscation Devlivery (POD) is the #1 source for Lua Obfuscation. Turn simple Lua scripts like a single line using the print command to over 1000 line heavily obfuscated scripts that utilize random characters to confuse anyone trying to get the source. POD was originally designed for ROBLOX Lua obfuscation in case you didn't want anyone to find the source code for one of your scripts. However, POD will work with any Lua format.
